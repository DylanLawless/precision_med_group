The \pmu can act as a leading user for a national sepsis registry.
Our analysis of public and private data allow us to accurately measure the number of cases per year in all institutions.
We can also provide examples of key data that is most valuable including routing clinical and demographic features, examples of how databases are structured, and example of how advance statistical analysis can use this data in daily management and research projects in combination with new technologies. 
Figure 
\ref{fig:national_registry1} (summary) and \ref{fig:national_registry2} (detailed)
 illustrates how we can accurate model the requirements of a national registry database:

\begin{itemize}
\item We can state that the total number of sepsis cases for 2010-2022 was 368'719. A typical year (2022) had 35'205 cases with per-institution averages of 22 (sd: 57, min-max 0-600).
\item We can give a breakdown of estimated numbers accurate for each institution.
\item We can identify the key players which have the largest number of adult and child cases (e.g. Insel Gruppe, Universitatsspital Zurich, Kantonsspital Baselland).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The database for a Swiss national sepsis registry until spanning from 2010-2030 will contain 400'000 cases. 
For each case it will contain at least a minimal set of 40 demographic and clinical data variables.}
We can advise on the architecture of the database and recommend commercial solutions for hosting a secure and accessible platform.

Figure 
\ref{fig:national_registry_snapshot} shows a snapshot of the demo national sepsis registry.
We have included variables that cover the minimal set of features and provide a number of optional advanced features which are important to research and future development. 
Table 
\ref{tab:national_registry_example} 
shows an example of features and data types that are captured.
The current modelled variables contain:
\texttt{Patient\_ID, Age, Gender, Diagnosis\_Code, Source\_of\_Infection, Organ\_Dysfunction, Treatment\_Administered, AMS\_Compliance, National\_Sepsis\_Pathway\_Used, Outcome, Sepsis\_Standard\_Met, Date\_Admission, Date\_Discharge, Date\_Follow\_up, study\_site, sex, age\_at\_bc\_days, age\_grp, ethnicity, category, ccc\_final, hosp\_sepsis, hosp\_delay, hosp\_los, hosp\_los\_bc, pathogen\_grp, focus\_grp, picu, picu\_reason, picu\_los, picu\_los\_bc, cahai, death\_30\_bc, death\_delay, cons05\_score\_agg, pelod\_score\_agg, psofa\_score\_agg, podium\_score\_agg}.
