\subsection{GenomeSwift}\label{GenomeSwift}

The integration of genomic technology into healthcare, especially for
rare diseases, represents a crucial frontier in medical science {[}1{]}.
Despite advancements, the fragmented nature of current genome analysis
methodologies in Swiss healthcare notably delays diagnoses and
treatment. The accumulation of extensive genomic datasets necessitates a
shift towards more integrated and automated processes {[}2{]}.

Our proposed GenomeSwift bioinformatic suite aims to address these
\textbf{unmet needs}. It is designed to automate and amalgamate various
genome sequence analysis processes, thus \textbf{feasibly} providing
swift, precise, and expansive insights into genetic diseases. This suite
adheres to FAIR data principles, ensuring advancement in research and
conformity with best data management practices in \\kispi.

The persistent bottleneck in translating genomic data into practical
clinical insights underscores the project\textquotesingle s necessity
{[}3{]}. Even with tools like the
\href{https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us}{Genome Analysis Toolkit}
setting standards for variant analysis, a comprehensive system
integrating these tools is essential for a robust analysis process
{[}4{]}. Our \textbf{previous developments} underpin GenomeSwift
(\textbf{Figure 1}) {[}5{]}, {[}6{]}, {[}7{]}. We have additionally
developed several tools that we are excited to integrate into the
pipeline, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/DylanLawless/ProteoMCLustR}{ProteoMCLustR}, a
  protocol for protein pathway clustering {[}8{]}, {[}7{]}.
\item
  SkatRbrain, a statistical analysis pipeline effective in analysing
  rare variants {[}9{]}, {[}10{]}, {[}11{]}.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/DylanLawless/archipelago}{Archipelago}, for
  unified genomic statistical analysis.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/DylanLawless/ACMGuru}{ACMGuru}, incorporating
  American College of Medical Genetics guidelines to translate genomic
  data into clinical recommendations {[}12{]}.
\item
  DeepInferR, for Bayesian analysis of genetic variant probabilities and
  their disease impacts.
\end{itemize}

By merging these tools into a unified pipeline, GenomeSwift aims to
elevate the efficiency and output of genomic data analysis in \kispi,
enabling real-time, high-throughput genomic data analysis for disease
discovery.
