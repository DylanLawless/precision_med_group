\subsection{Available resources}\label{available-resources}}

The GenomeSwift project will use existing resources and infrastructure
available through our collaborations and institutional support, ensuring
a cost-effective approach to its development and implementation.
\textbf{Institutional support}: Access to computational resources and
infrastructure provided by our collaborating institutions, including the
\href{http://smoc.ethz.ch/}{SwissMultiOmic Center}, ETHZ
\href{https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/LeoMed2/Leonhard+Med+Intro+for+shareholders}{SIS
Leonhard Med}, and University of Basel
\href{https://scicore.unibas.ch/}{sciCORE Med}. \textbf{Existing
grants}: We will also performed development as part of current funding
from related projects within our group which can be found at their
respective research project pages:
\href{https://www.swisspedhealth.ch/}{swisspedhealth.ch}, and
\href{https://www.epfl.ch/labs/fellay-lab/}{EPFL},
\href{https://www.chuv.ch/en/bdsc/research/our-groups/precision-medicine}{CHUV}.

\subsubsection{Personal costs (including social security
contributions)}\label{personal-costs-including-social-security-contributions}}

A senior staff scientist and a PhD student will each be employed 50\%
FTE to work on development, including social security contributions.
Additional funding is not required for the following: the main applicant
who will oversee the project, collaborating bioinformatics specialists
from UZH, ETHZ, EPFL, and CHUV who will integrate and optimise the
computational tools within GenomeSwift under their current roles within
their respective institutions; our collaborating clinical geneticists
who will review the clinical applicability and relevance of the
pipeline. Total personal costs are 90'448 CHF.

\hypertarget{material-costs}{%
\subsubsection{Material costs}\label{material-costs}}

Costs associated with high-performance computing (HPC) resources for
data processing and analysis are listed in Table 1, including discounts
covered by institutional support. Total costs are 7'628.
