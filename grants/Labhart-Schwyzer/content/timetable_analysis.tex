\section{Timeline and milestones}\label{timetable-analysis}

Our project timetable was designed and assessed using the critical path
method (CPM) and program evaluation and review technique (PERT). In
\textbf{Figure 2} (A) we present the network of project activities,
highlighting critical paths crucial for project completion.
\textbf{Figure 2} (B) illustrates the Gantt chart, detailing activity
timelines and critical paths, which we tested for effective project
scheduling. Lastly, \textbf{Figure 2} (C) shows the probabilistic
distribution of project completion time, where we tested the risk and
probability of meeting deadlines. Our analysis using CPM and PERT,
provides the optimal plan to assist in timely delivery of outcomes. With
a calculated probability of completion within 53 weeks at 0.97, the
project is highly likely to finish on time according to the PERT
analysis \citep{ref25}, \citep{ref26}, \citep{ref27}, \citep{ref28}, \citep{ref29}
