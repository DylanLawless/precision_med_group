\section{Summary}

GenomeSwift proposes a transformative leap in the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases through an automated genomic analysis platform, significantly enhancing clinical outcomes for paediatric patients at \textbf{UZH} and \kispi. Integrating cutting-edge tools like ProteoMCLustR and ACMGuru, the project promises to streamline fragmented diagnostic processes, ensuring rapid and precise medical insights,  starting in metabolic disease. This development aligns perfectly with the Labhart-Schwyzer Scholarship’s focus on advancing medical research and technology in metabolic diseases and related fields.

Directed by Dr. Dylan Lawless and supported by collaborations with \textbf{UZH}, ETHZ, EPFL, and CHUV, GenomeSwift epitomises interdisciplinary innovation, blending bioinformatics with clinical practice. With a 53-week timeline and focused deliverables, it aims to position \textbf{UZH} as a leader in precision medicine, enhancing both the scientific standing of young researchers and the global reputation of Zurich’s academic institutions in tackling complex healthcare challenges.
