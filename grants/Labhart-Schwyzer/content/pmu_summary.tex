 \subsection{Precision medicine unit operational design}
The  \pmu operates as a self-organised, start-up group composed of researchers and clinicians from \kispi, UZH, and ETHZ.
We apply advanced multi-omics technologies for quick diagnosis and tailored treatment strategies in pediatric care. The core philosophy centres on robust project management systems and cutting-edge bioinformatics pipelines to ensure swift clinical implementation of research findings. 
Our operational structure is based on a unified system framework that employs a single-source management philosophy to enhance data integration and operational efficiency. 
We uphold high standards by building for rigorous audit trails and version control systems. 
Funding will be used to develop bioinformatics tools, expand diagnostic platforms with new omics technologies.
