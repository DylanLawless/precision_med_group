GenomeSwift
Precision medicine in Kispi through rapid and automated genome analysis.
1 Background
The integration of genomic technology into healthcare, especially for rare diseases, represents a crucial frontier in medical science [1]. Despite advancements, the fragmented nature of current genome analysis methodologies in Swiss healthcare notably delays diagnoses and treatment. The accumulation of extensive genomic datasets necessitates a shift towards more integrated and automated processes [2].
Our proposed GenomeSwift bioinformatic suite aims to address these unmet needs. It is designed to automate and amalgamate various genome sequence analysis processes, thus feasibly providing swift, precise, and expansive insights into genetic diseases. This suite adheres to FAIR data principles, ensuring advancement in research and conformity with best data management practices in Kispi.
The persistent bottleneck in translating genomic data into practical clinical insights underscores the project's necessity [3]. Even with tools like the Genome Analysis Toolkit setting standards for variant analysis, a comprehensive system integrating these tools is essential for a robust analysis process [4]. Our previous developments underpin GenomeSwift (Figure 1) [5], [6], [7]. We have additionally developed several tools that we are excited to integrate into the pipeline, including:
    2
• ProteoMCLustR, a protocol for protein pathway clustering [8], [7].
• SkatRbrain, a statistical analysis pipeline effective in analysing rare variants [9], [10], [11].
• Archipelago, for unified genomic statistical analysis.
• ACMGuru, incorporating American College of Medical Genetics guidelines to translate genomic data
into clinical recommendations [12].
• DeepInferR, for Bayesian analysis of genetic variant probabilities and their disease impacts.
By merging these tools into a unified pipeline, GenomeSwift aims to elevate the efficiency and output of genomic data analysis in Kispi, enabling real-time, high-throughput genomic data analysis for disease discovery.

3 Detailed research plan
The GenomeSwift pipeline is designed to enhance genomic analysis through automation and integration of various analytical tools. Our detailed research plan outlines the methodology and statistical approaches we will employ to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of GenomeSwift in processing and analysing genomic data.
(i) Integration of existing tools: The pipeline will integrate several tools that we have developed, including: ProteoMCLustR for protein pathway clustering [7], [8]; SkatRbrain for statistical analysis of genetic data [9], [10], [11]; Archipelago for a unified representation for genomic statistical analysis; ACMGuru for clinical genetic interpretation [12]; AutoConstructR for protein structure plotting, facilitating a comprehensive interpretation of genetic variations [16]; and other modular tools.
(ii) Data processing and analysis workflow: Data input: GenomeSwift will accept raw genomic data, applying preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and compatibility. Variant detection: Utilising the best practices from tools like GATK, the pipeline will perform variant calling, ensuring high-confidence identification of genetic variations [4]. Statistical analysis:Employing SkatRbrain, the pipeline will conduct robust statistical analyses to associate genomic variations with disease phenotypes, including rare variant analysis [9], [10], [11]. Clinical interpretation: ACMGuru will be used to interpret the clinical significance of detected variants, aligning with the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines [12].
(iii) Simulation and validation: The pipeline's efficacy will be validated using simulated datasets encompassing various disease scenarios (rare variant, common variant, polygenic risk) to ensure its robustness across different genetic contexts [3], [17], [18]. Validation will also include real-world data from Swiss hospitals to confirm the pipeline's practical applicability and accuracy.
(iv) Statistical methodologies: GenomeSwift will incorporate advanced statistical methods to analyse the association between genetic variants and diseases, ensuring the analyses are powered adequately to detect significant associations even in the context of rare diseases. The pipeline will employ a range of statistical tests suitable for different data types and study designs, ensuring the flexibility and comprehensiveness of the analysis. Specifically, optimised sequence kernel association tests (SKAT-O) will form the basis of statistical validation tests [10]. Successful outcomes will therefore demonstrate the ability to substitute
