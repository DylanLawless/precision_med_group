## General notes

* Reviewers are mixed backgrounds and not always topic experts.
* Practice partner = real-world users. Hospital and clinicians are good example.
* Practice partners are not the other DIZH collaborators.
* Practice partners cannot be the same person as applicant; e.g. Luregn as both user and builder.
* Impact - affect on Zurich canton.
* Impact - disruptive / risks are welcome.
* 10-15 total projects are likley - probably 30% success if random.
* You can ask for money for your salary if you get letter from University confirm your chair.

## Budget Template DIZH at UZH

- **Different approach in the budget template:**
    * **First part of the template = Expenses:** Which (direct) costs are related to my DIZH Project (per DIZH university)?
    * **Second part of the template = Contributions:** How are these overall costs funded (by DIZH, by matching funds).
    * Costs that are paid with your own contribution have to be included in the expenses.
- **Calculatory overhead** 
    * Represents the overall infrastructure costs of DIZH universities for rooms and central services.
    * Calculated as 20% of total project costs and considered as matching funds.
- **Cost for assets are not allowed**
    * Costs for assets are not permitted, not even as matching funds.
    * Assets at UZH can be utilized for more than one year if costs exceed CHF 10,000.
- **Subcontracting** 
    * Services from third parties are only allowed up to CHF 100'000 or the maximum of 20% of the total project costs (of all partners); whatever is lower.
- **Practice partner** can only provide cash contributions (as third-party funds).
- **UZH does not provide a pot for Matching Funds**, you have to provide it yourself!
- **Matching funds** can be in the form of **preliminary work** from projects related to the submitted project, dating back no longer than 12 months before the application date (= 1 October 2023).
- The financial responsible person must issue a confirmation of matching funds. Templates via [dizh@dsi.uzh.ch](mailto:dizh@dsi.uzh.ch).
- **Matching from university funds** = **Redeployment of existing funds** (green section in the template):
    * Staff or material paid from Betriebskredit, Einrichtungskredit or other university funds; your salary or 10% of the professor can count as in-kind-contribution.
- **Matching from third-party funds** = **Third-party funds acquired** (content must be related & connection must be confirmed in the matching fund confirmation; orange section):
    * Staff or material paid from third party grants.
- **Exception:** DIZH funds can not be matching funds.
